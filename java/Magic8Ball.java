//8i-ball java.The idea is a simple magic 8-ball program complete with graphics.  
//Hopefully I will get extra credit
//Requirements: 20 possible answers, user must input a yes/no question. Output answer on an 8 ball, possibly more creative.
//Design: random number generator for the 20 possible values, use a swith statement to pick out the answer.  Use a driver method to drive.  And output onto an applet.
// The driver method should ask user to input a question. Then reply the answer on an 8 ball by creating an object and calling the answer method.  
//Then this method should be applied onto an applet.
